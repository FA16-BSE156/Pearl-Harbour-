# Pearl-Harbour-
Final Year Project (FYPII)
We are a group of three members, We have developed a desktop and android game whic is based on a histrical event, happened back in the world war two.
I have created a reposiotry and would upload the required code as instructed by our teachers.
We have developed the game using the unity engine, so i shall mainly focus on the coding and desiging implemented by us instead of focusing on the auto generated scripts.
