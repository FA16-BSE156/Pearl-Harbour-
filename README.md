# Pearl-Harbour-
Final Year Project (FYPII)
We are a group of three members, We have developed a desktop and android game whic is based on a histrical event, happened back in the world war two.
I have created a reposiotry and would upload the required code as instructed by our teachers.
We have developed the game using the unity engine, so i shall mainly focus on the coding and desiging implemented by us instead of focusing on the auto generated scripts.
I tried pushing the whole project but it wont let me push it as a whole,
I have created a master branch in a chronological order, The menu, including the audio control and level followed by the game manager, exit and enter, check landing etc mainstream functions, then following brnaches shall contain the scripts about player, NevMesh, raycast etc.
